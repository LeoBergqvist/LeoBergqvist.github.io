        <p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
        <p>Macrophighters is an engaging AR game where players try to eat incoming bacteria before they reach the
            bloodstream and cause fever. The project focused on creating an interactive AR experience, visually
            appealing graphics, and educating users about the immune system.</p>

        <p><strong>The Development of the App</strong></p>
        <p>Development began with a simple Unity MVP featuring basic game objects and straightforward logic.
            Improvements included detailed 3D models created in Blender, AR image tracking to define the game field, and
            enhanced interactions using haptics, sounds, and UI controls. Game logic evolved to include randomized
            bacteria movement and a counter to end the game if too many bacteria were missed.</p>

        <p><strong>Challenges & Learnings</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early user tests revealed the need for better instructions and feedback, leading to a start screen with
                instructions, plus haptics, sounds, and animations to signal successful actions.</li>
            <li>Balancing the educational content with engaging gameplay was challenging. After expert advice, the team
                scoped the project narrowly to focus on a small part of the immune system, turning the app more into a
                game inspired by the immune system than a strict educational tool.</li>
            <li>Further increased my knowledge of working in Unity</li>
        </ul>
