            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>   
            <p><em>HeardWhen</em> is a music trivia game inspired by the Swedish board game “När då då?”, where players guess the chronological order of songs from different decades.</p>

            <p>The objective is to collect as many songs or cards as possible, with the difficulty increasing as more are collected.</p>

            <p><strong>Game</strong></p>  

            <p>Songs are sourced from Spotify’s <em>decade-specific playlists</em> via the Spotify Web API.</p>

            <p>Players arrange songs on a shared board, placing them in the correct order based on release year.</p>

            <p>If a guess is correct, the song is placed and the player can choose to <em>Lock</em> their progress or <em>Continue</em> for more points.</p>

            <p>An incorrect guess discards that round’s cards and lets other players guess the exact year.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong></p>
            <p>Built with JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Vue, Firebase.</p>

            <p>The application features a setup menu, the main game board, a lock/continue option, and a year-guess input.</p>

            <p>Game data includes player states, locked cards, guesses, and scores.</p>

            <p><strong>API:</strong></p>

            <p>Spotify Web API to fetch song title, artist, and year information</p>
