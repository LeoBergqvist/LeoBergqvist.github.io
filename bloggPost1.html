                <p>"A practical exploration of tools, ideas, and principles that make the web work better for
                    everyone."</p>


                <section>
                    <h2>Starting the Journey</h2>
                    <p>This is the first post in a series where I’ll dive into UX and
                        accessibility; two topics that, once you really understand them, change how you see
                        the digital world.</p>

                    <p>Back in university, I had a lecturer who left a mark on me. He wasn’t teaching accessibility
                        from a distance; As a kid, he had been bound to a wheelchair, and later he worked
                        on all kinds of initiatives;from collaborating with disability groups to helping homeless
                        individuals build systems and habits to get back on their feet. He was essentially doing
                        real-world behavior design long before I even knew what that meant.</p>

                    <p>In his course I learned about visual and hearing impairments, but also
                        the less visible ones; ADHD, Asperger’s, and other neurodivergences that fundamentally shift how
                        someone experiences the web. Suddenly, “good UX” wasn’t just about clean interfaces. It was
                        about creating environments where more people can succeed with less friction.</p>

                    <p>One day he took us to an office staffed largely by people with disabilities. Watching them work
                        was like discovering hidden layers in tools we all take for granted. For example, watching a
                        blind user type on an iPhone using braille input:</p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Example: Typing Braille on an iPhone</figcaption>
                        <p><a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Entering+braille+on+my+iPhone+as+a+blind+person">Entering
                                braille on my iPhone as a blind person — YouTube</a></p>
                    </figure>

                    <p>I also learned that every feature in Facebook is accessible via keyboard alone—useful not only
                        for blind users but for anyone with limited vision or motor challenges. These small
                        considerations compound into real-world impact.</p>

                    <h2>Why Accessibility Matters More Than Ever</h2>
                    <p>Today, accessibility isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s increasingly a legal requirement.
                        Initiatives
                        like <strong>WCAG</strong> and the broader <strong>A11y</strong> movement (pronounced
                        “A-one-one-Y”) provide frameworks that help us design in a way that includes more people instead
                        of excluding them.</p>

                    <p>Because I want to actively contribute to this space in my work, I’m exploring these frameworks,
                        test the tools, and share the practical bits; so you can improve
                        your own code and process too. Even if only a few people read this blog, it will serve as a
                        place for me to point to when other's say “Where should I begin?”</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>A Talk Worth Starting With</h2>
                    <p>To kick things off, I’m using a fantastic conference talk from NordicJS. It’s approachable but
                        packed with the kind of insights that make you pause the video to take notes. The speaker lays
                        out several foundational concepts and tools I’ll be exploring throughout this series.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Nordic.js 2025 • Geisy Domiciano — Access-what? Why and How. A11Y for All
                        </figcaption>
                        <p><a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=NordicJS+2025+Geisy+Domiciano+Access-what">Watch

                    <h3>What Is Accessibility?</h3>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>“Accessibility is the quality of being easily reached, entered, or used by people who
                                have a disability.”</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>That’s the core. Everything else—guidelines, standards, best practices—are simply structured ways
                        of getting there.</p>

                    <p>And accessibility isn’t just for websites. As the talk points out, it applies to everything
                        around the web: tools, technologies, interfaces, mobile devices, smartwatches, and whatever we
                        invent next.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“It’s not just the web. It’s the tools around it;and the expectation that anyone with a
                            disability can use them… via any device we have now or invent in the future.”</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Accessibility Helps All of Us</h3>

                    <p>Here’s where it gets interesting: accessibility isn’t just for “other people.” You and I benefit
                        from it constantly.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Old phone</li>
                        <li>Broken arm</li>
                        <li>Eye infection</li>
                        <li>Noisy environment</li>
                        <li>Bright sunlight</li>
                        <li>Slow internet or limited bandwidth</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If the design works in these edge cases, it almost certainly improves the experience for the
                        average user. This is why designing for the extremes is one of the most powerful concepts in
                        product development.</p>

                    <p>And if you’re in the EU, accessibility is now encouraged—and in many cases enforced—by law.</p>

                    <h2>WCAG: The Framework Behind It All</h2>
                    <p>WCAG—the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines—is the backbone of global accessibility standards.
                        It defines three levels of accessibility and provides a structured way to evaluate your site.
                    </p>
                    <p>This topic deserves its own deep-dive post, so I’ll save the full breakdown for later.</p>

                                testing one of the highest-leverage moves you can make.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Each of these resources offers a different advantage—some help you understand the principles,
                        others help you enforce them systematically. Over the next few posts, I’ll explore how to
                        combine them into a workflow that’s both practical and scalable.</p>
