        <p><strong>Description:</strong> We were tasked with making a visualization for a teacher at KTH. The
            visualization gives an overview of teachers and courses with too many or too few
            allocated work hours. <Strong>We used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, D3.js</Strong>

        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>This project involved designing and implementing visual mappings and structures, based on insights from the
            Information Visualization course at KTH, to create a tool for the Director of Studies Jarmo Laaksolahti and
            other KTH staff. The goal was to replace error-prone spreadsheets with an interactive system that gives
            quick overviews of courses and teachers, supports better decision-making, and improves communication.</p>

        <p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a tool that would be actively used by KTH staff.</li>
            <li>Design an intuitive interface that is easy to use for all parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing and displaying large amounts of data within limited space.</li>
            <li>Designing a clear and simple UI for diverse users.</li>
            <li>Working with unfamiliar web frameworks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Visual Structures</strong></p>
        <p>The tool transformed spreadsheet data into various visual formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three static frames showing varying data over time.</li>
            <li>Main frame with teacher or course bubbles using preattentive features like color and size.</li>
            <li>Frame with selected teacher data including bar charts, icicle diagrams, and pie charts for course
                involvement.</li>
            <li>Detailed course view with bar charts for course parts and goal hours reached.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Learning Objectives Reached</strong></p>
        <p>I applied the visual information seeking mantra of “overview, zoom, filter, and details on demand,” learned
            to assess end-user needs through stakeholder collaboration, and improved design effectiveness, efficiency,
            usability, and usefulness. The project also developed the my skills in creating interactive visualizations,
            facilitating insights, and presenting to both peers and stakeholders.</p>

        <p><strong>Team Contribution</strong></p>
        <p>Responsible for designing the main Staffiz visualizations alongside two team members. Conducted research,
            brainstormed ideas, and ensured designs were informative, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly. Gained
            hands-on front-end experience in React.</p>
